,"The story of the 
PLARF/PLASAF, however, has been one of steady and progressive growth in both size and 
capability, beginning with the development of increasingly longer

,"The 1980s were a seminal decade for the 
PLASAF in two other ways: first, through its development of the DF

were stood up between 1980 and 2000, three of which were equipped with these latest weapons 
systems",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,
,"This expansion accelerated in the
 
2000s: between 2000 and 2010, the PLASAF stood up 
as many as eleven new brigades equipped with its growing array of weapons, including its first

conventional missile forces, in
 
particular the extent to which they are subordinate to the local joint 
theater command versus their individual PLARF bases, 
is
 
less well understood",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,
,"Initial evidence 
suggests that integration of conventional missile forces into the local theater command i
s ongoing,

local 
theater command 
may exercise
 
a degree of operational control over these forces, 
facilitating joint operations between missile forces and their air, land, and sea counterparts",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,

The PLARF controls nine bases, all of which are either Corps or Corps Deputy Leader grade",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,
,"Six 
of these bases, Bases 61
-
66, are responsible for ballistic missile operations, while the other three, 
Bases 67
-
69, conduct support missions (Base 67 is responsib
le for overseeing the central nuclear 
stockpile, Base 68 is responsible for engineering and physical infrastructure, and Base 69, the 
newest base, is poorly understood but appears to be responsible for both personnel training and 
missile tests)",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,

he six operations bases cover discrete geographical areas",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,

missile brigades of Base 61 cover eastern and some of southeastern China, Base 62 covers the rest

covers northwest and north

central China, Base 65 covers eastern and northeastern China, and Base 66 covers central China",2022-10-24 PLARF Organization.pdf,
,"Each base also features a unique makeup of nuclear and conventional forces depending on 
individual mission and strategic need: Base 6
1, for instance, is made up of mostly short

range 
conventional missile brigades primarily aimed at Taiwan, while more inland bases, such as Bases 
64 and 66, are made up primarily of longer
